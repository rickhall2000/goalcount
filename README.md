This is a collection code from a series on machine learning that I am writing on my blog, [onbeyondlambda.blogspot.com](onbeyondlambda.blogspot.com).  

## Usage

linear1.clj is the code from the post 
[Linear Regression with one variable](http://onbeyondlambda.blogspot.com/2014/07/linear-regression-in-clojure-part-i.html)

## Links
This is based on what I learned in the [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) course on coursera.  
Implementing these ideas in Clojure has been helped by the book [Clojure for Machine Learning](http://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Machine-Learning-Akhil-Wali/dp/1783284358/).  
The code uses [clatrix](https://github.com/tel/clatrix) and [Incanter](http://incanter.org/).
