This is a collection code from a series on machine learning that I am writing on my blog, [onbeyondlambda.blogspot.com](onbeyondlambda.blogspot.com).  

## Posts
The posts, and the related code files  
[Introduction](http://onbeyondlambda.blogspot.com/2014/03/ml-class-notes-lesson-1-introduction.html) No code in this post  
[Linear Regression with one variable](http://onbeyondlambda.blogspot.com/2014/07/linear-regression-in-clojure-part-i.html) linear1.clj  
[Linear Regression with multiple variables](http://onbeyondlambda.blogspot.com/2014/07/machine-learning-in-clojure-part-2.html) linear2.clj  

## Links
This is based on what I learned in the [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) course on coursera.  
Implementing these ideas in Clojure has been helped by the book [Clojure for Machine Learning](http://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Machine-Learning-Akhil-Wali/dp/1783284358/).  
The code uses [clatrix](https://github.com/tel/clatrix) and [Incanter](http://incanter.org/).
